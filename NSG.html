It has 8636 personnel (including 1086 personnel for regional hubs.[166]). The NSG also includes the Special Ranger Group (SRG), whose 3,000 personnel provide protection to India's VVIPs.
Special Protection Group
The Special Protection Group (SPG) was formed in 1988 by an act of the Parliament of India to "provid[e] proximate security to
the Prime Minister of India and former Prime Minister of India and members of their immediate families (wife, husband, children and parents)". For former Prime Ministers and their dependents, a regular review is held to decide whether the threat to their life is high enough to warrant SPG protection.
Railway Protection Force
The Railway Protection Force (RPF) was established under the Railway Protection Force Act 1957. The RPF is charged with providing security for Indian Railways.[167]
It has a sanctioned strength of 75,000 personnel.</p>
