<font size="9" color="maroon"<p>India has been in possession of nuclear weapons since 1974. Its most recent nuclear test took place on 11 May 1998, when Operation Shakti (Pokhran-II) was initiated with the detonation of one fusion and three ?ssion bombs. On 13 May 1998, two additional ?ssion devices were detonated. However, India maintains a "no?rst use" and a nuclear deterrence policy against nuclear adversaries. Its nuclear doctrine envisages building a credible minimum deterrent for maintaining a "second strike capability" which would be massive and designed to induce
unacceptable damage on the enemy.[177] India is one of only four nations in the world to possess a Nuclear Triad. India's nuclear missiles include the Prithvi, the Agni the Shaurya, the Sagarika, the Dhanush, and others. India conducted its ?rst test with the Agni-V in April 2012 and a second test in September 2013. With its 5,000 kilometres (3,100 mi) range, it can carry a nuclear warhead to the east to include all of China, and to the west deep into Europe.[178] Agni-VI, with a perceived range of 6,000–8,000 kilometres (3,700– 5,000 mi) is also under development with features like multiple independently
targetable re-entry warheads (MIRVs).[179][180]
India also has bomber aircraft such as the Tupolev Tu-142 as well as ?ghter jets like the Sukhoi Su-30MKI, the Dassault Mirage 2000, the MiG-29 and the HAL Tejas capable of being armed with nuclear tipped bombs and missiles.[181] Since India does not have a nuclear ?rst use policy against an adversary, it becomes important to protect from a ?rst strike. This protection is being developed in the form of the two layered Anti-ballistic missile defence system.
India's Strategic Nuclear Command controls its land-based nuclear warheads, while the navy controls the ship and submarine based missiles and the air force the air-based warheads. India's nuclear warheads are deployed in ?ve area.

<p>The BrahMos is a Mach 3 Supersonic Cruise Missile developed in collaboration with Russia. Its land attack and anti-ship variants are in service with the Indian Army and Indian Navy. Sub-Launched and Air Launched variants are under development or testing.
The BrahMos II is a Mach 7 Hypersonic Cruise Missile being developed in collaboration with RussiaIndia has a declared nuclear no-?rst-use policy and is in the process of developing a nuclear doctrine based on "credible minimum deterrence". In August 1999, the Indian government released a draft of the doctrine[194] which asserts that nuclear weapons are solely for deterrence and that India will pursue a policy of "retaliation only". The document also maintains that India "will not be the ?rst to initiate a
nuclear ?rst strike, but will respond with punitive retaliation should deterrence fail".[194]
The fourth National Security Advisor of India Shivshankar Menon signalled a signi?cant shift from "no ?rst use" to "no ?rst use against non-nuclear weapon states" in a speech on the occasion of the Golden Jubilee celebrations of the National Defence College in New Delhi on 21 October 2010, a doctrine Menon said re?ected India's "strategic culture, with its emphasis on minimal deterrence".[195] However, whether the policy shift actually took place or not is unclear.[196] Some
argued that this was not a substantive change but "an innocent typographical or lexical error in the text of the speech".[197] India's current PM Modi has, in the run up to the recent general elections, reiterated commitment to no ?rst use policy.[198] In April 2013 Shyam Saran, convener of the National Security Advisory Board, a?rmed that regardless of the size of a nuclear "attack against India," be it a miniaturised version or a "big" missile, India will "retaliate massively to in?ict unacceptable damage".[199] Here, the term "attack against India" means attack against the "Union of India" or "Indian forces anywhere".
