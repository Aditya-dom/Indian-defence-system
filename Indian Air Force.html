<font size="7" color="maroon"><p>The Indian Air Force is the air arm of the Indian armed forces. Its primary responsibility is to secure Indian airspace and to conduct aerial warfare during a conict. It was ofcially established on 8 October 1932 as an auxiliary air force of the British Raj and the prefx Royal was added in 1945 in recognition of its services during World War II. After India achieved independence from the United Kingdom in 1947, the Royal Indian Air Force served the Indian Air Force
Dominion of India, with the prefx being dropped when India became a republic in 1950. The Indian Air Force plays a crucial role in securing Indian airspace and also in India's power projection in South Asia and Indian Ocean. Therefore, modernising and expanding the Indian Air Force is a top priority for the Indian government. Over the years, the IAF has grown from a tactical force to one with transoceanic reach. The strategic reach emerges from induction of Force Multipliers like Flight Refueling Aircraft (FRA), Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) and credible strategic lift capabilities.

<p>The Indian Air Force (IAF) made progress towards becoming a truly network-centric air force with the integration of Air Force Network (AFNET), a reliable and robust digital information grid that enables accurate and faster response to enemy threats, in 2010. The modern, state-of-theart AFNET is a fully secure communication network, providing IAF a critical link among its command and control centre, sensors such as the Airborne Early Warning and Control Systems, and attack platforms such as ?ghter aircraft and missile launchers. Integrated Air Command and
DRDO AEW&CS
Control System (IACCS), an automated command and control system for Air Defence (AD) operations will ride the AFNet backbone integrating all groundbased and airborne sensors, AD weapon systems and C2 nodes.

The Medium Multi-Role Combat Aircraft (MMRCA) competition, also known as the MRCA tender, was a competition to supply 126 multi-role combat aircraft to the Indian Air Force (IAF). The Defence Ministry has allocated ~ US$13 billion for the purchase of these aircraft, making it India's single largest defence deal. The MRCA tender was ?oated with the idea of ?lling the gap between its future Light Combat Aircraft and its in-service Sukhoi Su-30MKI air superiority ?ghter. On 31 January 2012, it was announced that Dassault Rafale won the competition due to its lower life-cycle
g
cost. However the tender was cancelled in July 2015.[134] The Indian Air Force (IAF) is also in the ?nal stages of acquiring 22 Apache Longbow gunships, armed with Hell?re and Stinger missiles in a $1.2 billion contract and 15 heavy-lift Boeing CH Chinook helicopters.[133] The IAF has initiated the process for acquisition of additional Mi-17 IV helicopters, heavy lift helicopters, Advanced Light Helicopter and Light Combat Helicopters. Among trainer aircraft, the Hawk Advanced Jet Trainer has been inducted and the Intermediate Jet Trainer (IJT) would be acquired in the near future.
In recent times, India has also manufactured its own aircraft such as the HAL Tejas, a 4th generation ?ghter, and the HAL Dhruv, a multi-role helicopter, which has been exported to several countries, including Israel, Burma, Nepal and Ecuador. A weaponised version of Dhruv is called the HAL Rudra, which is armed with high-velocity M621 20 mm cannon, longrange 70 mm rockets (8 km), air-to-air missiles (Mistral-II), and MAWS (missile approach warning system).[135] Combat in Kargil highlighted the requirement of an attack helicopter specially made for such high-altitude operations. The HAL Light Combat Helicopter (LCH) is a multi-role
combat helicopter being developed in India by Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) for use by the Indian Air Force and the Indian Army. The LCH is being designed to ?t into an anti-infantry and anti-armour role and will be able to operate at high altitudes.[136] LCH will be ?tted with indigenous anti-tank missile Helina.
India also maintains unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) squadrons (primarily Searcher-II and Heron from Israel) which can be used to carry out ground and aerial surveillance.[137] India is also testing its own long-range Beyond Visual Range missile| (BVR) an air-to-air missile named
Astra,[138] and also building a Medium Altitude Long Endurance Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) called Rustom.[139]
India is also in an ambitious collaboration programme with Russia to build ?fthgeneration ?ghter aircraft, called HAL/Sukhoi FGFA which will be based on the Russian Sukhoi Su-57 ?ghter. Earlier in 2013, the two sides completed the preliminary design of the FGFA and are now negotiating a detailed design contract.[140] Although there is no reliable information about the Su-57 and FGFA speci?cations yet, it is known from interviews with individuals in the Russian
Air Force that it will be stealthy, have the ability to supercruise, be out?tted with the next generation of air-to-air, air-to-surface, and air-to-ship missiles, and incorporate an AESA radar.
Joint co-development and co-production of Multi-role Transport Aircraft (MTA), by Russian partners and HAL, is being launched to meet the requirements of the Russian and Indian Air Forces. The aircraft will be designed for the roles of a 15–20 ton cargo / troop transport, paratrooping / airdrop of supplies including Low Altitude Parachute Extraction System (LAPES) capability. It will be con?gured such that all
types of cargo can be transported, and the aircraft would be capable of operating from semi-prepared runways. The MTA is expected to replace the Indian Air Force's ageing ?eet of Antonov An-32 transport aircraft. The aircraft is expected to conduct its ?rst ?ight by 2017, and to enter service by 2018.[141]
To protect IAF assets on the ground, there has been a search for short-range surfaceto-air missile. India has begun deploying six Akash surface-to-air missile (SAM) squadrons in the northeast to deter Chinese jets, helicopters and drones against any misadventure in the region.
